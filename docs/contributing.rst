We also have some :ref:`troubleshooting` information that may be helpful.


Pull Requests
-------------

Pull requests are always welcome to fix bugs and improve support for Mandrill and Django features.

* Please include test cases.
* We try to follow the `Django coding style`_ (basically, PEP 8 with longer lines OK).
* By submitting a pull request, you're agreeing to release your changes under under
  the same BSD license as the rest of this project.

.. Intentionally point to Django dev branch for coding docs (rather than Django stable):

Testing
-------

Djrill is `tested on Travis <https://travis-ci.org/brack3t/Djrill>`_ against several
combinations of Django and Python versions. (Full list in
`.travis.yml <https://github.com/brack3t/Djrill/blob/master/.travis.yml>`_.)

Most of the included tests verify that Djrill constructs the expected Mandrill API
calls, without actually calling Mandrill or sending any email. So these tests
don't require a Mandrill API key, but they *do* require
`mock <http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/mock/index.html>`_.

To run the tests, either::

    python -Wall setup.py test

or::

    python -Wall runtests.py


If you set the environment variable `MANDRILL_TEST_API_KEY` to a valid Mandrill
`test API key`_, there are also a handful of integration tests which will run against
the live Mandrill API. (Otherwise these live API tests are skipped.)
